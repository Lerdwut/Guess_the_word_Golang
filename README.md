# Guess_the_word_Golang
This miniproject is a practice in coding with the Golang programming language. It involves creating a game where users guess individual letters. If a guessed letter is correct, its position in the word is revealed. Users continue coding until they either correctly code the entire word or reach a maximum of 15 guesses.
